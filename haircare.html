    <h1>Hair Care</h1>
    <p>Even though we're best known for our skin care, we carry a variety of hair products including shampoos, conditioners, styling products, styling tools and special treatments. Shampoos provide the basis for healthy hair, removing impurities and excess oils. Many of our shampoos also offer other benefits such as moisturizing and reparative properties. </p>
    <br>
    <p>A conditioner should always follow the shampoo since conditioners seal in moisture and de-tangle to prevent breakage and split ends. Our complementing shampoos and conditioners cleanse and hydrate while improving the health of the hair. Styling products come in different forms including mousses, gels, sprays and pomades. The differences include consistency, benefits and results for the hair. Some people like soft control while others like a heavily molded style.</p>
    <br>
  
    <p>Styling tools such as dryers and flat irons help to create a glamorous style with minimal time and damage to the hair. New technology has made it possible to have super model locks without paying the price. Since our hair is often plagued by a variety of challenges, treatments are available to help restore and revive thinning hair, deliver intense moisture to brittle locks and provide smoothness to unruly and frizzy ends.</p>
